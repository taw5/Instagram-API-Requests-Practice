# instagramrotatepfp
Rotating Instagram profile pictures through its API. Please note that this is only for educational purposes and does not aim to break TOS... All you gotta do is make sure in the same folder you got an image that you want to rotate and fits the dimensions required for Instagram's pfps (although I automatically scale it), and then run the program utilizing your username, password, and email. Any usage is the responsibility of the user, this **project** was made to learn how APIs work. 

NOTE: Please don't adjust the jitter or the amount of max rotations unless you understand the formula. Instagram API is restricted to approximately 200-500 API calls per hour, will get you soft-banned for 24 hours if you spam their API, as of course that's not allowed. To use safely just have no more than 120 rotations per hour. 2 rotations per minute, or 1 rotation every 30 seconds...
